# BlockEstate: Revolutionizing Real Estate Investment with Blockchain Technology

BlockEstate offers an innovative and functional platform that utilizes blockchain technology to make real estate investments easier, more accessible, and more secure. The main goal of the project is to change the way people invest in real estate and how properties are transferred between owners.

## How it works 

Properties are represented as tokens which equals a percentage in property ownership following the ERC20 standard.

## Benfits of the system

With the introduction of web3 tech comes a lot of benefits:
 - legal automation -> legal and business logic can be implmented (due to the nature of solidity) and imbued inside the smart contracts logic, for example paying taxes on collectted rent or trnasferring ownership to successors when someone dies  
 - zero trust -> blockends are deployed once and stay, so evryone can check the source code to see if something is off and if one redeploys the blockend its easy to spot unlike traditional backends where its almost impossible
 - security -> if blockchain is introduced it makes it hard for people with mallicious people trying to exploit the system do something since because of first there is a ledger system
 - ease of use -> since most of th things will be taken care of the smart contract verifying and transfering ownership is much easier ( if not eliminating documents, atleast reducing the amount so checking the owner of the property and a renter whe nneeding a sticker for blue zone will be automated )
 - fractional ownership -> the use of tokens enables fractional ownership ( if one is not possible all tokens are just in the possesion of one address/person ) which could enable people to share various things in real estate, for example when one person wants to buy a property which he will use as rental property or he just wants to participate in the real setate bussiness but doesnt have enough money today he will start asking relatives or friends for help but there is one probelm - trust and thats where tokens help since everything is zero trust instead you can directly become an owner of part of the tokens associated with a part of this property with the person who have asked you for help while granting a layer of protection in which since you own the tokens you could always sell them if you want, another use case where this could be useful is rent, if a group of people again buy x, y, z shares of property when its given for rent, rent could be distributed acording to each person's share
 - things like mortage can be easily implemented using 2/3 multisig and timelock

## Disclaimer

Since the core of the project is the tokenization if properties and leveriging the other benefits iof web3 tech ( mentioned above ) the system can be fit into systems with little modification, for example if this is not used by the government it could be used by different real third parties using only part of the system: 
 - first example a third party needing capital for buying or building properties will get funding from the tokenization and then when the third party gives them for rent, its distributed across the investors and the third party getting a percentage from each transaction and the third party takes care of all the rest of legal work ( to be precise a real world example will be a third party builder needing funcding for a new project where all the apartments will be for rent will collect funding from the tokenization and each token holder will be paid percentage of the rent where the third party gets a percent from each transaction)

## And more
The basic idea of the project is to make real estate (and other areas where possible) more accesible as an investment, verifying ownership easier, *trading* them eaier, taking care of some of the annoying legal things that could be automated and reducing mediaries. Since the fundamental is just that,  the legal details can be fit into the system *** see concerns for some questions *** 

## Addressing Ownership Concerns

 

### What if i want to live in a property, wouldnt this make the market even more competitive leaving no more room for people actually using for what it is
 - ### Well this is the legal part which should be regulated by the government but a way is to introduce some kind of algorithm to determine who is the physical owner of the property (for example having 51%) and the other 49 is just an asset which you could buy later, how would this relate to a real world example but making it better - lets say you need to buy new apartment but you dont have enough so you start going through your family contacts nut you dont have luck, but then you remember you have a friend who is trying to find a property to buy but for pure capital gain so you ask him and he accepts nut comes a problem: how can he trust you that you will give him his paart after five years, well thats why web3 is called zero trust - now he can become an investor in the property  




## Conclusion
In conclusion, BlockEstate aims to facilitate the process of investing in real estate by making it more accessible and efficient through representing properties as tokens on the blockchain network. This approach changes traditional methods of investing and ownership, offering new opportunities for users to participate in the real estate market.

## Features that can be implemented easily using this system 

 - mortgage using 2/3 multisig and timelocking 

 - of rent is paid through the system as well, the sums will be transferred to all owners with named o their corresponding percentage 



##--------------------things for me to see where to add them, will reomve in the future
It's important to note that with BlockEstate's functionality, owning the entire property is no longer necessary to participate in its ownership. This opens doors for new opportunities for co-ownership of properties and simplifies the sales and transfer process. Why you would think? - a lot of people nowadays dont buy real estate just for living in it and instead as a solid way to help presfrve their money in time against time, did you know in there is a monopoly of the ~ 1% precent in real estate not leaving much for a lot of people, with this you will be able to own fraction of the property along with other people (for example in a prearanged group, but why should this be better than just using a mediary and getting money from relatives? - well things happen and this prmoises arent written anywhere so the human trust factor and moral are the limiting factor, while with this system this prearanged group and financing logic everything is in the system and you wont need the meiary and if someone`s messes up you still have the propert share)
