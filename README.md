6# BlockEstate: Revolutionizing Real Estate Investment with Blockchain Technology

BlockEstate, the real estate registry, offers an innovative and functional platform that utilizes blockchain technology to make real estate investments easier, more accessible, and more secure. The main goal of the project is to change the way people invest in real estate and how properties are transferred between owners.

## Functionality
With its functionality, BlockEstate allows real estate properties to be represented as tokens on the blockchain network. This creates an opportunity for users to own a portion of the property by purchasing or owning tokens representing a share of the property. For example, if a property is divided into 100 tokens, one person can purchase 10 tokens and thus own 10% of the property. This model makes real estate investments more accessible to a larger portion of society.

### How It Works
When a property is represented by tokens, users can buy tokens to acquire a percentage of the property. For instance, to own the property outright, one would need to possess 100 tokens. Business logic, implemented by smart contracts, ensures smooth transactions.

## Transfer of Ownership
With property ownership recorded on the blockchain network, the process of transferring properties becomes easier and faster. Token owners can easily transfer their shares of the property by selling or transferring their tokens through smart contracts, preventing unnecessary bureaucratic procedures and expenses while also decreasing the meed of doing legal work since law logic that is easier, mundane and repetitive can be imbued into the smart contract logic.

## Fractional Ownership
It's important to note that with BlockEstate's functionality, owning the entire property is no longer necessary to participate in its ownership. This opens doors for new opportunities for co-ownership of properties and simplifies the sales and transfer process. Many individuals nowadays invest in real estate not just for personal use but also as a means of wealth preservation. However, real estate ownership is often monopolized by a small percentage of the population, leaving limited opportunities for others. With fractional ownership facilitated by BlockEstate, individuals can pool resources to collectively invest in properties, reducing the reliance on intermediaries and increasing transparency and security within prearranged groups, while also leaving some of the legal things to the smart contract instead for paying a lawyer ( you will probably still need one just not as much).

## Tax Automation
A completely new dimension is introduced with the possibility of automating tax processes. Through the use of smart contracts, the corresponding tax is automatically deducted with each token transaction, providing transparency and security for all participants in the transaction.

## Different Types of Properties
There could be two types of real estate properties available - partial and whole. Whole properties would be represented by tokens where purchasing the token grants full ownership of the property. Partial properties, on the other hand, could still be beneficial in cases where a business is not financially sound. In such cases, the business could mortgage the property it operates in, allowing people to buy shares, and the business would receive the funds. This approach could eliminate the need for traditional bank mortgages, allowing direct interaction between individuals.



## And more
The basic idea of the project is to make real estate (and other areas where possible) more accesible as an investment, verifying ownership easier, *trading* them eaier, taking care of some of the annoying legal things that could be automated and reducing mediaries. Since the fundamental is just that,  the legal details can be fit into the system *** see concerns for some questions *** 

## Addressing Ownership Concerns

 

### What if i want to live in a property, wouldnt this make the market even more competitive leaving no more room for people actually using for what it is
 - ### Well this is the legal part which should be regulated by the government but a way is to introduce some kind of algorithm to determine who is the physical owner of the property (for example having 51%) and the other 49 is just an asset which you could buy later, how would this relate to a real world example but making it better - lets say you need to buy new apartment but you dont have enough so you start going through your family contacts nut you dont have luck, but then you remember you have a friend who is trying to find a property to buy but for pure capital gain so you ask him and he accepts nut comes a problem: how can he trust you that you will give him his paart after five years, well thats why web3 is called zero trust - now he can become an investor in the property  




## Conclusion
In conclusion, BlockEstate aims to facilitate the process of investing in real estate by making it more accessible and efficient through representing properties as tokens on the blockchain network. This approach changes traditional methods of investing and ownership, offering new opportunities for users to participate in the real estate market.

## Features that can be implemented easily using this system 

 - mortgage using 2/3 multisig and timelocking 

 - of rent is paid through the system as well, the sums will be transferred to all owners with named o their corresponding percentage 



##--------------------things for me to see where to add them, will reomve in the future
It's important to note that with BlockEstate's functionality, owning the entire property is no longer necessary to participate in its ownership. This opens doors for new opportunities for co-ownership of properties and simplifies the sales and transfer process. Why you would think? - a lot of people nowadays dont buy real estate just for living in it and instead as a solid way to help presfrve their money in time against time, did you know in there is a monopoly of the ~ 1% precent in real estate not leaving much for a lot of people, with this you will be able to own fraction of the property along with other people (for example in a prearanged group, but why should this be better than just using a mediary and getting money from relatives? - well things happen and this prmoises arent written anywhere so the human trust factor and moral are the limiting factor, while with this system this prearanged group and financing logic everything is in the system and you wont need the meiary and if someone`s messes up you still have the propert share)
